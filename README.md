Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. ref: https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1
We are investigating the leading causes of cardiovascular disease, looking at trends between 
  geograhical location;
  demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, and EFU composition, number of children, educational attainment, source of income, and socio-economic status), and  in our present time; and
  history (e.g., look at leading causes 20 years ago)
