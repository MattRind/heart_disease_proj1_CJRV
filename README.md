Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. ref: https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1
We are investigating the leading causes of cardiovascular disease, looking at trends between 
  geograhical location;
  demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, and EFU composition, number of children, educational attainment, source of income, and socio-economic status), and  in our present time; and
  history (e.g., look at leading causes 20 years ago)

  q1 Is there a correlation between alchohol comsumption and heart disease?
We conducted a two sample t-test of AlcoholDrinker/Non-Drinker & heart disease. The t-statistic of 18.1505142963367 indicates a substantial difference between the means of the two sample groups. A higher t-statistic suggests a larger difference between the sample means. However, the P-value is 1.38 and is greater than alpha (0.05) so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and there is no significant difference between the two groups. 
  q2. How does heart disease differ by sex?

  q3 How does body fat (BMI) / level of inactivity influencd heart disease?

  Relationship Between Daily Food Consumption and Likelihood of Developing Heart Disease

  q4 Is smoking the leading cause of heart disease?
We conducted a two sample t-test of Smoker/Non-smoker & heart disease. 
The t-statistic of -61.297861168863285 indicates a substantial difference between the sample data and the population data. The magnitude of the t-statistic suggests a significant discrepancy in means. The P-value was 0.0 and suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis. With a t-statistic of -61.297861168863285 and a p-value of 0.0, we reject the null hypothesis. The results are highly statistically significant, indicating that the observed difference between the sample and population means is not due to random chance.

The findings support the alternative hypothesis, suggesting that there is a real and significant difference between the smoker and non-smoker data.
